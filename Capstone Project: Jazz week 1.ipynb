They have engaged us to execute neighborhood analysis in Manhattan to identify the most favorable areas for this venture.\n\nFirst some background on the proposed business:\n\nDuring the day the venue will operate as a regular gourmet coffee shop but with a jazz theme, with vintage memorabilia such as autographed photos and records on display, and jazz playing through a sound system. This isn't just another coffee shop however: although coffee will be the primary daytime business the venue will include a stage area in the back for jazz performances at night, when alcohol will be available in addition to coffee.\n\nNot only will formal shows be staged, several times a week the venue will host \"open mic\" sessions, with a house band ready to serve as a backing group to play standards with customers who want to perform. My clients plan to have professional-grade audio/visual equipment to record these sessions so that customers can purchase a recording of their performance.\n\nThe belief is that by having a coffee shop as the main daytime purpose of the business, with a love of jazz as the focus, the shop/club will attract jazz-loving customers for the coffee and music and help build an audience for the evening shows.",

Our approach will be to identify neighborhoods with a higher concentration of music\u2013related activity, but which would also be good locations for a business selling coffee.",

The underlying neighborhood data is a list of boroughs, neighborhoods and associated coordinates publically available from New York University.\n\nBy using FourSquare to highlight neighborhoods with music venues and other music-related businesses (e.g. record stores), then clustering them accordingly, we can identify areas where music is popular and musicians like to spend time. Once a target list is identified we will execute analysis of coffee shop density to identify an area within that list where there is a lower concentration of existing shops.\n\n\n\n",
